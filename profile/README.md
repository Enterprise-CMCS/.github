# Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services (CMCS)

## Medicaid and CHIP Business Information Solution
Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) are changing and will continue to change moving forward. With the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid and CHIP enrollment has grown to over 72 million beneficiaries. This exceeds enrollment in Medicare. The Centers for Medicaid and CHIP Services (CMCS) manages billions of federal dollars granted to states for their information technology (IT) expenditures to modernize state systems to meet growing demands.

In 2010 the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) initiated the Medicaid and CHIP Business Information Solution (MACBIS) to meet mandates requiring reliable, comprehensive, and timely Medicaid and CHIP operational and programmatic data supported by leading edge technology and analytics solutions. MACBIS is an enterprise-wide initiative to ensure the Medicaid and CHIP data infrastructure and technology are commensurate to the programsâ€™ role in evolving health care delivery reforms, access to coverage, and to enable proper monitoring and oversight. Aside from data needs to support the multi-billion dollar waiver negotiations, CMS will use MACBIS data for program integrity, evaluation of demonstrations, actuarial analysis, quality of care analysis, and to share this rich data set with states, stakeholders, and the research community.

MACBIS currently consists of four major projects: Medicaid and CHIP Program (MACPro), the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T-MSIS), the Medicaid Drug Rebate (MDR) program, and the Medicaid and CHIP Financial (MACFin) program.
